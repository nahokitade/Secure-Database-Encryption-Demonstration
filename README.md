README for HW3 of STEP Google Tokyo, Japan

The code demonstrates how to securely store passwords within databases even with database and hash function leak. 
The code does not of course implement the database itself, but demonstrates how the backward search from common password to username is hard for a criminal hacker even with the leak.

Assumptions:
1. password does not contain non ASCII characters.
